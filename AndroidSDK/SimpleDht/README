Project Name: Simple Distributed Hash Table

Details:A simple DHT based on Chord. Although the design is based on Chord, 
	it is a simplified version of Chord; I do not implement finger tables and 
	finger-based routing; I also do not handle node.
        Therefore, there are three things I have implemented: 
	1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning,
	2) Ring-based routing
        3) Node joins.


Environment : 
    
    0. Use  create_avd.py in the python SDK to create 5 avds
       python create_avd.py [#of Avds]  [path to the sdk]
    1. Your app should open one server socket that listens on 10000.
    2. You need to use run_avd.py and set_redir.py to set up the testing
       environment. 
       python run_avd.py 5
       pyhton set_redir.py 10000
    3. The grading will use 5 AVDs. 
       The redirection ports are 11108, 11112, 11116, 11120, and 11124.
    4.You should just hard-code the above 5 ports and use them to set up connections.

Greader:
    Three different Os graders for testing this App
    Make sure you have installed the app in these 5 avds
    To use this grader in linux or Mac OS
    You need to give the permission to the grader 
    then Type
    ./ [Gradername] [path to the app-debug.apk]
