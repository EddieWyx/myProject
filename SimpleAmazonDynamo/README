Project Name: Simple Amazon Dynamo-style key-value storage
Details: Implemented a simplified version of Dynamo. 
	(And you might argue that itâ€™s not Dynamo any more ;-) 
	There are three main pieces I implemented: 
	1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling.


Environment : 
    
    0. Use  create_avd.py in the python SDK to create 5 avds
       python create_avd.py [#of Avds]  [path to the sdk]
    1. Your app should open one server socket that listens on 10000.
    2. You need to use run_avd.py and set_redir.py to set up the testing
       environment. 
       python run_avd.py 5
       pyhton set_redir.py 10000
    3. The grading will use 5 AVDs. 
       The redirection ports are 11108, 11112, 11116, 11120, and 11124.
    4.You should just hard-code the above 5 ports and use them to set up connections.

Greader:
    Three different Os graders for testing this App
    Make sure you have installed the app in these 5 avds
    To use this grader in linux or Mac OS
    You need to give the permission to the grader 
    then Type
    ./ [Gradername] [path to the app-debug.apk]
